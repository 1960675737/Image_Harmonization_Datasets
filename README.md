# Image_Harmonization_Datasets

**Image Harmonization** is to harmonize a composite image by adjusting its foreground appearances consistent with the background region. A real composite image is generated by a foreground region of one image combined with the background of another image. Though it's easy to create real composite images, the harmonized outputs are too time-consuming and skill-demanding to generate. So there is no available dataset.

Our dataset is a synthesized dataset for Image Harmonization. It contains 4 sub-datasets: HCOCO, HAdobe5k, HFlickr, and Hday2night, each of which contains synthesized composite images, foreground masks of composite images and corresponding real images.

- ### HCOCO

[HCOCO](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1cjDBYWZYiqKgFNPL62LLEg) , containing 50k synthesized composite images, is generated based on [**Microsoft COCO**](<http://cocodataset.org/>) dataset. The foreground region is corresponding object segmentation mask provided from COCO. Within the foreground region, the appearance of COCO image is edited using various color transfer methods.



- ### HAdobe5k

[HAdobe5k](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1EnaKSLfr_CTn6CbyQeEyMg) is generated based on [**MIT-Adobe FiveK**](<http://data.csail.mit.edu/graphics/fivek/>) dataset. Provided with 6 editions of the same image, we manually segment the foreground region and exchange foregrounds between 2 versions.



- ### HFlickr

We collected 5460 images from [**Flickr**](<https://www.flickr.com/>). After manually segmenting the foreground region, we use the same method as HCOCO to generate [HFlickr](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1EMUBmQWwQbUEOfFMIPsRxg) sub-dataset.



- ### Hday2night

[Hday2night](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1ia_P3-cmjwbpsfszntbTmQ) is generated based on [**day2night**](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1bCtVhhtb_EDool_UnN2Bjw) dataset. We manually segment the foreground region, which is cropped and overlaid on another image captured on a different time.
